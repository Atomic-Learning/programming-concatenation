In programming, concatenation is the operation of joining two or more data structures together to form a new data structure. Data structures such as strings, lists, and arrays, key-value collections, and even more complex data structures can be concatenated. In many languages concatenation is performed using the <code>+</code> operator.

Usually, the original data structures remain unchanged after concatenation, and a new data structure is created to hold the combined elements.

<h2>String Example</h2>

<pre><code>string1 = "Hello, "
string2 = "world!"
combined_string = string1 + string2

print(combined_string) // Output: "Hello, world!"
print(string1) // Output: "Hello, "
print(string2) // Output: "world!"
</code></pre>

<h2>Array Example</h2>

<pre><code>array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_array = array1 + array2

print(combined_array) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(array1) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(array2) // Output: [4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<h2>Uses</h2>

Concatenation is a fundamental operation in programming and is used in various contexts, such as:
<ul>
    <li>Building complex data structures from simpler ones.</li>
    <li>Combining strings for output or further processing.</li>
    <li>Merging lists or arrays to create a single collection of elements.</li>
</ul>
